				<p>Anyone who reads Old and Middle English literary texts will be familiar with the mid-brown volumes of the EETS, with the symbol of Alfred's jewel embossed on the front cover. Most of the works attributed to King Alfred or to Aelfric regular sequence of new editions, normally one or two per year;
				</p>
				<br>
				<p style="text-indent: 30px;">As its name states, EETS was begun as a 'club', and it retains certain features of that even now. It has no physical location, or even office, no paid staff or editors, but books in the Original Series are published in the first place to satisfy subscriptions paid by individuals or institutions.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p style="text-indent: 30px;">Editors, who receive no royalties or expenses and who are only very rarely.
